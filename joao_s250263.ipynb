    "The stacked area chart illustrates the proportional share of road traffic (motor vehicles) versus bike traffic in Copenhagen over a 10-year period, from 2005 to 2014. The red area represents road traffic, while the green area represents bike traffic, shown as a percentage of the total traffic volume each year.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the visualization, a clear trend emerges: road traffic has steadily decreased in proportion, while bike traffic has gained ground. In 2006, road traffic accounted for the overwhelming majority of total traffic—over 90%. However, by 2014, its share had dropped to just over 80%, with bike traffic growing correspondingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "This shift suggests a gradual but meaningful transition in urban mobility habits in Copenhagen, aligning with the city’s efforts to promote sustainable transportation. Investments in bike infrastructure, such as dedicated lanes and bike-friendly urban planning, likely contributed to this change. Although road traffic remains dominant, the consistent growth in bike usage indicates a cultural and infrastructural shift towards more environmentally friendly and health-conscious commuting options.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this data highlights how policy and infrastructure changes can influence transportation behavior, making Copenhagen a model for sustainable urban transit development."

    "\n",
    "The interactive line chart displays the number of traffic accidents in Copenhagen across different hours of the day, with the ability to select each day of the week. This visualization reveals distinct daily traffic patterns that reflect human behavior, commuting routines, and differences between weekdays and weekends.\n",
    "\n",
    "A consistent trend can be observed on weekdays (Monday to Friday): accident numbers spike during morning (around 7–9 AM) and evening rush hours (around 3–6 PM). These peaks correlate with times when people commute to and from work or school, resulting in increased road activity and a higher likelihood of accidents.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, weekends (Saturday and Sunday) show a significantly lower volume of accidents throughout the day. This is likely due to reduced traffic as fewer people commute for work. On weekends, the peaks—though smaller—tend to occur in the afternoon hours, suggesting more recreational or leisure travel rather than routine commutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern highlights the impact of urban activity and human mobility on road safety. Rush hours during the workweek present higher risks, emphasizing the need for targeted traffic management, road safety campaigns, and perhaps infrastructure adjustments to reduce accident occurrences during these periods.\n",
